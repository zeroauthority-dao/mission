Business Source License (BSL) v1.0

Summary
Add a Business Source License (BSL) v1.0 to ZeroAuthorityDAO repositories, effective January 1, 2022. The license explicitly permits use of the most recent commercial version and includes a clear contact clause for commercial or ambiguous use cases.

Motivation
Current licensing does not clearly state:

* whether the most recent commercial version may be used by default
* how users should handle edge cases or out-of-scope use
* when and how the code converts to an open-source license

This creates unnecessary ambiguity for builders and contributors.

What this change includes

* Business Source License (BSL) v1.0
* Effective Date: January 1, 2022
* Change Date: January 1, 2026 (or earlier at ZA’s election)
* Change License: Apache License 2.0
* Explicit permission to use the Permitted Commercial Version
* Restriction on competing commercial services prior to the Change Date
* Commercial inquiries clause directing users to [https://linktr.ee/zeroauthoritydao](https://linktr.ee/zeroauthoritydao)

Why this matters

* Clarifies commercial rights and boundaries
* Reduces accidental license violations
* Encourages direct engagement instead of silent forks
* Preserves a clear path to open source

Acceptance criteria

* License file added at repo root
* README updated to reference the new license
* Effective Date and Change Date clearly stated
* Commercial contact clause included

Optional follow-ups

* Define “competing commercial service” more narrowly
* Split licensing between protocol contracts and platform / agent code
* Add SPDX identifier

This is intentionally boring in the best way. Licenses should read like physics, not poetry.
