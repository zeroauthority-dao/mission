Business Source License (BSL) v1.0 with explicit commercial-use permission and contact clause

---

### Summary

Introduce a Business Source License (BSL) v1.0 for ZeroAuthorityDAO codebases, effective January 1, 2022, with a clear grant allowing use of the **most recent commercial version**, plus an explicit escalation/contact clause for ambiguous or out-of-scope use.

This aligns licensing intent with real-world usage while reducing ambiguity and accidental non-compliance.

---

### Motivation

Current licensing language does not clearly:

* Allow use of the most recent commercial version by default
* Channel edge cases into human discussion instead of legal risk
* Define a clear Change Date and post-conversion open-source path

BSL is designed to set strong defaults while keeping the door open for collaboration, not litigation.

### Proposed License Text

(see full draft below / attached in this issue)

> Business Source License (BSL) — ZeroAuthorityDAO
> Version 1.0 — Effective Date: January 1, 2022
>
> Includes definitions, grant of rights, usage limitations, commercial escalation path, Change Date conversion, and standard warranty/liability disclaimers.

### Why This Matters

* Makes commercial intent explicit instead of implied
* Reduces accidental license violations
* Encourages builders to engage rather than fork quietly
* Keeps protocol + platform aligned with long-term open-source conversion

Subtle but important: ambiguity is routed to conversation, not courtrooms.

---

### Open Follow-Ups (Optional, Not Blocking)

* Define “competing commercial service” more narrowly
* Split licensing between protocol contracts and platform / agent code
* Add SPDX identifier once finalized

---

### Acceptance Criteria

* License file added to repo root
* README references updated license
* Effective Date and Change Date clearly stated
* Contact clause included verbatim
